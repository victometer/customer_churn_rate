### Case Study investigating customer churn at a ficticious telecom company - Databel

# Problem:
Customer churning rate has increased over the past year

# Process:
Analyse the data:
1. Establish how many customers there are and how many have left - create a churn rate field out of this
2. Graph the reasons customers leave, see which ones are most common
3. Map the location of the customers, see which state has the highest churn rate
4. Investigate the payment plans and contracts. Are there clear plans that customers churn on?!

# Results:
I have observed the following:
1. Customer churn rate is 27% overall
2. Highest churn rate is in senior customers
3. Highest churn rate by state is California
4. Most common reason for churn is better competitor offers
5. Highest rate of churn per contact type was in customers who are on a monthly roll-on basis, they're also the ones who're paying the most.
